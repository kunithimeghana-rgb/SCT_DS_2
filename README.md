Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Author: [vishnusiddarthboppu] Dataset: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle link)

ðŸ“Š Overview This project demonstrates comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover relationships, patterns, and trends in the dataâ€”laying the foundation for future modeling and prediction.

Objectives Perform robust data cleaning:

Handle missing values, fix data types, and remove duplicates.

Engineer new features (e.g., FamilySize).

Conduct meaningful EDA:

Visualize distributions & relationships.

Identify trends affecting passenger survival.

Tools & Libraries Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

(or Microsoft Excel for some data cleaning steps)

Import Titanic dataset (CSV/Excel).

Data Cleaning

Remove duplicates.

Handle missing values (impute Age, fill/categorize Embarked and Cabin).

Correct data types.

Feature engineering (e.g., FamilySize).

Exploratory Data Analysis

Summary statistics (mean, median, outliers).

Univariate and bivariate visualizations with seaborn/matplotlib.

Patterns explored: survival rates by Gender, Class, Age, Fare, Embarked, and FamilySize.

Insights

Females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.

Higher fares correlated with increased survival probability.

Children and specific family structures impacted survival chances.

How To Run Clone/download this repository.

Place the Titanic dataset file in the project directory (train.csv or train.xlsx).

Open Titanic_Data_Cleaning_and_EDA.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Lab.

Run cells sequentially to reproduce data cleaning and EDA process.
